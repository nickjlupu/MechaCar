* data:  [MechaCar_mpg.csv](MechaCar_mpg.csv), [Suspension_Coil.csv](Suspension_Coil.csv) 

## Analysis
R code can be found in the script file:  [MechaCarChallenge.RScript](MechaCarChallenge.RScript).  I have also included the file in this repo that I preferred to work from [MechaCarChallenge.R](MechaCarChallenge.R) since the format was cleaner (e.g. comments differentiated by color).  <br>

A short write-up is included in the file:  [MechaCarWriteUp.txt](MechaCarWriteUp.txt)
